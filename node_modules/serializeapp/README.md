##serializeapp
---
serializeapp is a node utility module to serialize a Qlik Sense app into a JSON object.  
Pass it a [qsocks](https://github.com/mindspank/qsocks) app class and it returns the JSON representation of that app.

Returns a promise as standard but also accepts classical node style callbacks.  
Verified to work in the browser using browserify or webpack.

##examples

Connect to Qlik Sense Desktop, open a app and pass that into serializeapp.

```javascript
var qsocks = require('qsocks')
var serializeapp = require('serializeapp')

qsocks.Connect().then(function(global) {
	
	global.openApp('Executive Dashboard')
		.then(function(app) {
			return serializeapp(app);
		})
		.then(function(data) {
			console.log(data) // --> A JSON Object describing the app.
		})
	
})

```
